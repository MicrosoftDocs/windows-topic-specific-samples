# Input injection sample (mouse to touch)

This sample supports the [Simulate user input with input injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/input-injection) topic on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we demonstrate how to simulate touch input in a basic UWP application. Specifically, we have two input areas, each with four buttons. One input area is for handling mouse input by the user, while the other is for injecting touch input corresponding to the user's mouse input.

We focus on the following:
* Mouse input
* Touch input injection
