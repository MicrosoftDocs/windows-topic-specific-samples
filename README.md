# RadialController customization

This sample supports the [Surface Dial interactions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/input/windows-wheel-interactions) topic on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we demonstrate how customize the functionality of a Windows wheel device (like the Surface Dial) in a UWP application. 

We focus on the following:
* Button click and rotation gestures 
* Screen contact
* Custom menu items
