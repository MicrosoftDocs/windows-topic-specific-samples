# UWP commanding sample (StandardUICommand)

This sample supports the [Commanding in Universal Windows Platform apps using StandardUICommand, XamlUICommand, and ICommand](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/commanding) topic on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we demonstrate how to implement custom commanding in a basic UWP application using the StandardUICommand class. 

We focus on the following:
* StandardUICommand Delete
* Expose the command across controls and user experiences
