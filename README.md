This repo contains special-case, one-off samples that have been created just for specific topics in the windows-uwp or winrt-api repos. 

The purpose of this repo is solely to provide convenient zip-file downloads for the topics to link to. 
To enable this, each sample is in its own "orphaned" branch - that is, a branch with no relationship to other branches in the repo. 
This works because GitHub generates independent zip files for each branch. 

Most Windows samples have more general appeal, so they are published under the Microsoft org on GitHub - for example, in [windows-universal-samples](http://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples).
