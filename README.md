# Ink Analysis sample

> **Note:** The default platform target is ARM, change this to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device.

This sample supports the [Pen interactions and Windows Ink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/pen-and-stylus-interactions) topics on the [Windows Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

In this sample, we demonstrate how to support Windows Ink in a basic UWP application and use the [Windows.UI.Input.Inking.Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.input.inking.analysis) APIs to recognize text and shapes. 

We focus on the following:
* Adding basic ink support
* Supporting handwriting recognition
* Supporting shape recognition
* Highlighting text types (writing region, paragraph, line, and words)
* Redo/undo recognition
